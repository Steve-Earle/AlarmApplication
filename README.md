# Snoozer

Snoozer is an alarm application for Android with a small twist: it guarantees that you wake up, and stay up, through use of an active user input that must be maintained to silence the alarm.

## Snoozer Features: 
- The creation of multiple alarms
- A calender date-picker and scrolling time-selector 
- The use of user uploaded audio files for alarm ringtones
- The option to add an active user event that must be completed to turn off the alarm
- A simple and user friendly UI

## Active User Events:

When an alarm activates it will begin to play its associated audio file at full volume. The screen will display a button that must be pressed consistently to reduce the audio volume, and continuing until the set amount of time (set by the user at alarm creation) has elapsed. If the button is not pressed consistently, the audio will shoot back up in volume, and the timer will reset.

Active user events keep the user engaged long enough to become fully awake and mitigate the possibility of falling back to sleep.

## Notes

Snoozer is a simple application for anyone with a difficulty waking up. I made it for myself and have found it to helpful in getting myself started in the morning. Hopefully you will too.
